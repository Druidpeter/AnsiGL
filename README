| AnsiGL -- A string "graphics" library					     |
==============================================================================


    AnsiGL is a C++ console text "graphics" API using simply ASCII characters
and ANSI escape sequences, and all without the use of any video hardware.  It
strives to be a simple-to-use text-graphical toolkit have with an intuitive
interface for developers, while maintaining a sufficiently high degree of
flexibility.

    Many comparable APIs tend to either use video hardware, or are simply not
as fully-featured as one might hope or expect, at least in the area of visual
elements. AnsiGL can serve to bridge that gap easier, and since it "renders"
to a std::string (or optionally, an ncurses WINDOW *), integration should be
relatively easy with just about any project. Bindings to ncurses are provided
to allow for rapid, fully-featured application development with old and
familiar friends, along with AnsiGL.


==== Features ====

    * Provides easy-to-use GUI-style features to text-based applications

    * Extremely easy to integrate to any project (ultimately becomes a
      std::string)

    * 256 color support with ANSI xterm-256color escape codes (can also
      optionally render to the standard 8 or 16 color ANSI)

    * UTF-8 support, so any glyph can be rendered as long as your terminal
      will display it (though it is recommended to stay within the ANSI
      character set for maximum client compatibility)

    * Comes with ncurses support allowing rendering to a WINDOW * (with
      ncursesw)


==== Things that work ====

uchar       - A unicode-aware 'char', effectively
ustring     - A std::string-like implementation based on uchar instead of
              char
achar       - An ANSI-enabled 'uchar'
astring     - A std::string-like implementation based on achar instead of
              char or uchar

Point2D     - A simple (x,y) coordinate class
Area2D      - Effectively identical to point in that its just 2 integers,
              only these are Width and Height instead of coordinates
FixedArea2D - An Area2D with a Point2D "fixing" it to a location in space

Point3D     - A simple (x,y,z) coordinate class
Area3D      - Effectively identical to point in that its just 3 integers,
              only these are Width, Height and Depth instead of
              coordinates
FixedArea3D - An Area3D with a Point3D "fixing" it to a location in space

Pixel       - A specialized achar that serves as the basis for a Surface
Surface     - The most-basic (meaningful) rendering context of AnsiGL

Content	    - An interface for being placed within a Context
Context     - A collection of content within a specific space; based upon
	      Content so rendering contexts can be nested

Image       - A content-based surface
Animation   - A collection of Images with a video-like interface

Window      - A context with a decorated viewport (Note: This is the only
              "violation" of the 'Things that work' label...  Coming with
              the next update though...)
TextWindow  - A Window with alignment/word-wrap/formatting options for text

==== ansigl_ncurses ====

- A separate (optional) extension library to provide better ncurses
  integration (AnsiGL should probably not ever implement input
  handling/etc.)
- Mostly a simple collection of functions for ncurses compatibility
- The most notable is RenderToNcurses() to render a Surface out to an
  ncurses WINDOW (usually stdscr).
- It is recommended to use ncurses with wide character support in order
  to display unicode


- Note: AnsiGL supports more ANSI codes than ncurses (and most terminals).
        In addition, nearly every terminal tested without ncurses has
        performed very differently in terms of which ANSI codes are
        supported.  This is probably why the ncurses team didn't bother,
        but since they have already been added, there's no real need to
        remove them since they do function appropriately.


==== Known issues ====

- None currently (worth noting here, at least)


==== In progress... ===

InputWindow - A specialized TextWindow for echoing input
ChatWindow  - A TextWindow with an InputWindow attached under it,
              essentially

Desktop     - A specialized Window for managing multiple Windows within it
              Something akin to the Panel library of ncurses


==== Other misc. plans ====

- Animations; probably something like vector< Sprite > with functions to
  set the current frame, advance frames, etc.  Nearly everything but timing.
- Some sort of an optionally stand-alone or integrated timing mechanism for
  animations?
- More "drawing" functions
- Menus and other useful "widgets"
