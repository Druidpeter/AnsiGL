==== In Progress ====

InputWindow - A specialized TextWindow for echoing input
ChatWindow  - A TextWindow with an InputWindow attached under it,
	      essentially

Workspace   - A specialized Window for managing multiple Windows within it
	      Something akin to the Panel library of ncurses


==== Other Misc. Plans ====

    * Give sprites the ability to pseudo-rotate (0,90,180,270)

    * Animations; probably something like vector< Sprite > with functions to
      set the current frame, advance frames, etc. Nearly everything but timing
      Some sort of an optionally stand-alone or easily-integrated timing 
      mechanism for animations

    * Improve rendering efficiency over the network (and more) by adding 
      double-buffering and optionally using VT100 codes to allow for updating only 
      the "dirty" parts of the new render

    * More "drawing" functions
          More Primitives (circles, triangles, etc.)
          Fill functions (wide-scale color manipulation)
          Line drawing (possibly using a single character or a Sprite as a 
	              brush)
    * Menus and other useful "widgets"
          Menu bars
          Listbox menu
          Pull-down menu
          Buttons
          Check boxes
          Radio Buttons
          Sliders
          Graphs
          Dialogs
