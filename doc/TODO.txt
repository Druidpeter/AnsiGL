In Progress

    An expansion beyond ASCII? Multiple character sets, or possibly UTF-8
    support? (UTF-8 support added, but not yet checked in (coming soon!))
    An expansion beyond 16-color ANSI? (Mostly complete along with a color palette system that supports up to 256 colors (also coming soon!))


Things that are planned for sure (I think):

TextWindow - A Window with alignment/word-wrap/formatting options for text
InputWindow - A specialized TextWindow for echoing input
ChatWindow - A TextWindow with an InputWindow attached under it,
essentially

Workspace - A specialized Window for managing multiple Windows within it
Something akin to the Panel library of ncurses


Other Misc. Plans:

    Give sprites the ability to pseudo-rotate (0,90,180,270)
    Animations; probably something like vector< Sprite > with functions to
    set the current frame, advance frames, etc. Nearly everything but timing
    Some sort of an optionally stand-alone or easily-integrated timing mechanism for
    animations
    Improve rendering efficiency over the network (and more) by adding double-buffering and optionally using VT100 codes to allow for updating only the "dirty" parts of the new render
    Along with above
    More "drawing" functions
        More Primitives (circles, triangles, etc.)
        Fill functions (wide-scale color manipulation)
        Line drawing (possibly using a single character or a Sprite as a brush)
    Menus and other useful "widgets"
        Menu bars
        Listbox menu
        Pull-down menu
        Buttons
        Check boxes
        Radio Buttons
        Sliders
        Graphs
        Dialogs
