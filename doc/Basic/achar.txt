| Class: achar								     |
==============================================================================


==== Overview ====

    An 'achar' is simply a standard 'char' paired with a list of ANSI codes.
This is absolutely the most basic element of AnsiGL. Even though no other
classes are directly based upon achar, all other AnsiGL classes will be
affected by changes to this class.


==== Needs ====

    ANSI handling should be separated into its own class, then reintegrated 
here as a public member.

    In the ANSI change, color palettes should be utilized. After learning 
more about ncurses color handling, there are benefits of their palette use 
that could be used for gaming effects (like color cycling), but ours will 
probably automatically load all possible combinations in a master palette 
instead of making the developer choose, in addition to customizable palettes 
that could be swapped around. If palettes are created at all, they should 
also be generic enough so that multiple classes can take advantage of them. 
This way, Windows could utilize palettes for their borders to have easily 
player-customizable color schemes, while at the same time Sprites can utilize 
palettes for color-cycling animations (a D&D style color spray spell could 
look awesome if it were animated for glyphs as well as palettes, for example)


==== Relationships ====

    Inheritance:
        Parents:
            uchar
        Children:
            None
    Related:
        Nearly everything*

(*Note: While there is no direct inheritance with this class, everything else 
is essentially based upon this building block.)


==== Member Variables ====

Data Type 		Name 	Details
---------------------------------------
ColorDef		Color 	The ANSI color information
bool			Bell	If set, this character will beep when
				rendered


==== Member Functions ====

Name		 	Details
-------------------------------
HasAttribute()		Returns 'true' if the achar has the provided attribute
CopyAttribute()		Copies the attributes from another achar
AddAttribute()		Adds an attribute
AddAttributes()		Adds a list of attributes
RemoveAttribute()	Removes an attribute
RemoveAttributes()	Removes a list of attributes

HasAnsi()		Returns 'true' if there is ANSI to render

Clear() 		Clears all ANSI and sets the glyph a space: ' '

RenderAnsi() 		"Renders" only the ANSI codes the terminal expects
Render() 		"Renders" the character, ANSI and all, to a 
			std::string
