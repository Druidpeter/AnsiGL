Class: achar
Overview

An 'achar' is simply a standard 'char' paired with a list of ANSI codes. This is absolutely the most basic element of AnsiGL. Even though no other classes are directly based upon achar, all other AnsiGL classes will be affected by changes to this class.
Needs

    ANSI handling should be separated into its own class, then reintegrated here as a public member.
    In the ANSI change, color palettes should be utilized. After learning more about ncurses color handling, there are benefits of their palette use that could be used for gaming effects (like color cycling), but ours will probably automatically load all possible combinations in a master palette instead of making the developer choose, in addition to customizable palettes that could be swapped around. If palettes are created at all, they should also be generic enough so that multiple classes can take advantage of them. This way, Windows could utilize palettes for their borders to have easily player-customizable color schemes, while at the same time Sprites can utilize palettes for color-cycling animations (a D&D style color spray spell could look awesome if it were animated for glyphs as well as palettes, for example)

Relationships

    Inheritance:
        Parents:
            None
        Children:
            None
    Related:
        Nearly everything*

(*Note: While there is no direct inheritance with this class, everything else is essentially based upon this building block.)
