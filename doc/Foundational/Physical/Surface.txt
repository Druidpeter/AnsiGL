Class: Surface
Overview

A Surface is a collection of pixels, arranged logically in a rectangular format akin to any conventional rendering context for any other graphics library. The pixel resolution of AnsiGL is (as expected, I'm sure) a single term character.
Relationships

    Inheritance:
        Parents:
            None
        Children:
            Sprite -- The Surface lineage dedicated to being content
            Window -- The Surface lineage dedicated to displaying content (even though they can also be used as content as well)

Member Variables

Data Type 	Name 		Details
unsigned int 	TabSize 	The number of spaces that make up a tab character '\t' on this Surface
bool 		RenderANSI 	
bool 		UseCLS 		If enabled, an ANSI clear screen code is rendered as the first character
bool 		UseENDL 	If enabled, a std::endl "\r\n" is sent after each scanline has been rendered (useful when logical screen sizes are smaller than "physical" term size)
bool 		UseLF 		Like UseENDL, but '\n' instead
bool 		UseCR 		Like UseENDL, but '\r' instead


Member Functions

Name 		Details
GetScanline() 	Returns an astring that represents a single scanline
GetPixel() 	Gets the value of a pixel on the surface
SetPixel() 	Sets a value of a pixel on the surface (Note: The Draw*() functions are usually preferred to SetPixel()!)
Size() 		Returns an area that represents the size of the surface
Resize() 	Resizes the surface to the size of the area given
Width() 	Gets/sets the width of the surface
Height() 	Gets/sets the height of the surface
Clear() 	Clears the surface (ANSI and glyphs)
HasPoint() 	Checks to see if the provided Point is within the bounds of the Surface
