| Class Overview:                                                            |
==============================================================================

    Basic:
        uchar -- A unicode 'char' class
            achar -- ANSI-enabled uchar
        String -- A pure-virtual template class to create an std::string-like 
		  implementation for any type of "char"
            ustring -- uchar-based String
            astring -- achar-based String

    Foundational:

        Spacial:
            Point2D -- A 2-dimensional point
                Area2D -- A 2-dimensional area
                    FixedArea2D -- A 2-dimensional area fixed to a to a 
				   3-dimensional point in space
                Point3D -- A 3-dimensional point
                    Area3D -- A 3-dimensional area
                        FixedArea3D -- A 3-dimensional area fixed to a
				       3-dimensional point in space

            Note: Typedefs exist for backwards compatibility and ease of use: 
		  Point defaults to Point2D, Area to Area2D and FixedArea to
		  FixedArea2D

        "Physical":
            Pixel -- The primary building block for all visible objects, most 
		     notably for our Surface class
            Surface -- The primary/basic rendering target used throughout 
		       AnsiGL

    Objects:
        Content -- Anything that we might want to display; pure-virtual 
		   base-class for all objects, derived from Surface
	    Animation -- A collection of images with video-like controls
            Context -- Anything that can contain content (this itself is 
		       content, so we can have nested viewports, etc.)
                Window -- A special context that serves as a viewport over a 
			  larger logical surface size, with optional borders
		    TextWindow -- A window that has special handling to
				  handle text content (like a log window)
	    Camera --  A separate viewport for a context, contained within an
		       object that itself is placeable within a context (a
		       "TV screen" object of sorts)
	    Clone -- A content object that simply copies some other piece of
		     content; effectively allowing multiple placements of the
		     same content, without creating a full copy.
            Image -- An "image" (ANSI/FANSI art, or whatever might constitute 
		     an image in text); essentially a Content-based Surface
                Animation -- One of those fancy "moving pictures"...
            Text -- The basic text class
